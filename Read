Deep-Learning-for-NLP-Resources

List of resources to get started with Deep Learning for NLP. (Updated incrementally)
Deep Learning (general + NLP) links:

    https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6Xpj9I5qXYEcOhn7TqghAJ6NAPrNmUBH : This lecture series has very good introduction to Neural Network and Deep Learning.

    https://www.coursera.org/course/neuralnets : This lecture series is from Geof Hinton. The concepts explained are bit abstract, concepts are hard to understand in first go. Generally people recommend these lectures as starting point but I am skeptical about it. I would suggest going through 1st one before this.

    https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE6Wd9FR--EfW8dtjAuPoTuPcqmOV53Fu : Deep Learning Lectures from Oxford University

    https://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lisa/pointeurs/TR1312.pdf : This is a short book on Deep Learning written by Yoshua Bengio. It deals with theoritical aspects related to Deep Architectures. Great book though.
